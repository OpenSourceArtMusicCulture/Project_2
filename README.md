# Project_2 Audio: Composing with Open Source Tools

Audio Due Date: Wednesday, October 26, 2016, start of class


Using the "PD lab.pd" patch from last week's Pure Data lab session as a starting point, create a musical composition that explores melodic sequence, rhythm, sample playback and basic synthesis.

Your composition may take _any_ form and may be of _any_ style of music. Some examples of approaches you might consider could include:

 - a highly-rhythmic contrapuntal Bach fugue of oscillators driven by sequenced note arrays
 - an abstract ambient soundscape blending slowed-down samples from soundsnap.com or freesounds.org
 - a dynamic generative music system using keys on your computer's keyboard as control triggers and FM synthesis as a sound source
 - a "radio-play" where you record your own voice speaking excerpts from Francis Bacon's "The New Atlantis" augmented by sample playback and synthesized sounds (see http://www.gutenberg.org/files/2434/2434-h/2434-h.htm)
 
This is a long way of saying, the creative direction of this assignment is up to _you_. 

Your composition must be created primarily in Pure Data. The output from your Pure Data patches must be recorded to one stereo .wav file. You may record multiple audio files in Pure Data and then build your piece using an audio editing tool like Audacity (download: http://www.audacityteam.org/).

To successfully complete the assignment, you must submit the following files compressed into one .zip file:

1) a stereo audio file that is your complete composition.
2) your Pure Data patches and audio samples used in creating your composition.
3) a brief written description of your composition including a Title, an explanation of how you created your project and what you were trying to accomplish.
